 Project Overview:
Build a career recommendation system that not only suggests suitable careers based on a user’s skills, interests, and qualifications — but also predicts long-term career trajectories and suggests upskilling paths, using multi-modal data (e.g., resume text, social media activity, academic transcripts, and behavioral assessments).

🧠 Core ML/DL Components:
NLP & Resume Parsing (Transformer-based Models):

Use BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful features from resumes and cover letters.

Skill extraction, experience clustering, domain identification.

Personality & Interest Matching (ML + Psychometric Analysis):

Use questionnaire data (based on RIASEC, MBTI, or Big Five).

Train ML models (Random Forest / XGBoost) to map personality + skills to ideal careers.

Career Path Forecasting (Sequence Modeling with LSTM/Transformer):

Train on datasets of real-life career progressions (e.g., from LinkedIn public profiles or Kaggle datasets).

Predict the next best roles over 5–10 years based on current position and skillset.

Skill Gap Analyzer (DL + Knowledge Graph):

Use a knowledge graph of career-skill-job-role relationships (like O*NET or ESCO).

Identify missing skills and recommend personalized courses (using course APIs like Coursera or Udemy).

Recommendation Engine (Hybrid: Content + Collaborative Filtering):

Recommend careers based on similar users, clustered using unsupervised methods (KMeans/DBSCAN).

Combine with content-based filtering from resume and profile embeddings.

📊 Input Sources:
Resume / LinkedIn Profile (text)

Academic transcript (grades, majors)

Psychometric test results (online survey)

Skill tags / certifications

Career goals (optional)

🎯 Output:
Top-N Recommended Careers with confidence scores

Roadmap: Possible future roles (career trajectory tree)

Skill-gap report with upskilling suggestions

Salary and industry trends

📚 Datasets You Can Use:
O*NET database

Kaggle datasets: LinkedIn Career Paths, Resume datasets

ESCO (European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations)

MOOCs APIs for course suggestions (Coursera, Udemy)

💡 Enhancements:
Integrate GPT-based feedback generation on user profile (“Your resume aligns well with X, consider improving Y…”).

Use SHAP or LIME for interpretability (why a career is recommended).

Chatbot interface using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for conversational guidance.

🧩 Modules & Roadmap by Technical Domain
🔹 1. NLP & Resume Parsing
Goal: Convert unstructured resume/profile data into structured embeddings and skill sets.

Phase	Tasks
✅ Phase 1	Collect sample resumes and LinkedIn profile data. Use pdfplumber or PyMuPDF for parsing.
✅ Phase 2	Fine-tune BERT or DeBERTa-v3 for Named Entity Recognition (NER) — extract skills, job roles, orgs, dates.
✅ Phase 3	Use SentenceTransformers to create vector embeddings for each resume/profile.
✅ Phase 4	Store embeddings in FAISS or Elasticsearch for fast similarity search.

🔹 2. Psychometric Analysis & ML Mapping
Goal: Map personality/interest assessments to suitable career domains.

Phase	Tasks
✅ Phase 1	Integrate personality questionnaire (e.g., RIASEC or Big 5) into UI.
✅ Phase 2	Train classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict career clusters from survey + skill data.
✅ Phase 3	Use SHAP/LIME to explain model outputs per user.

🔹 3. Career Trajectory Prediction (DL)
Goal: Predict user’s future roles using historic career data.

Phase	Tasks
✅ Phase 1	Collect public career datasets (LinkedIn, Kaggle, O*NET).
✅ Phase 2	Train LSTM/Transformer model on sequences of job roles and industries.
✅ Phase 3	Visualize predicted career trajectories using tree or Sankey diagram.

🔹 4. Skill Gap Analysis & Upskilling Recommendation
Goal: Identify missing skills and recommend courses from MOOCs.

Phase	Tasks
✅ Phase 1	Build skill-job-role mapping graph using Neo4j and data from ESCO/O*NET.
✅ Phase 2	Compare user profile vs desired role to compute skill gaps.
✅ Phase 3	Use MOOC APIs (Coursera, Udemy) to fetch real-time course suggestions for missing skills.
✅ Phase 4	Rank courses using embeddings + FAISS similarity (course-title ↔ user-skill-gap).

🔹 5. Recommendation Engine
Goal: Suggest top careers using hybrid filtering.

Phase	Tasks
✅ Phase 1	Content-based filtering using skill/resume embeddings.
✅ Phase 2	Collaborative filtering using LightFM with user feedback data.
✅ Phase 3	Combine into hybrid engine with tunable weight between CF and content-based.

🔹 6. Conversational AI Assistant (Chatbot + RAG)
